### Naive approach - O(n*n)
#### Problem: buld a function that taxes two strings an in input and determines if for every value in the first array, there's a squared correspondent value in the second array. The frequnecy is important so this means if we have 3 values of 3 in the first array, we should have exactly 3 values of 9 in the second.
